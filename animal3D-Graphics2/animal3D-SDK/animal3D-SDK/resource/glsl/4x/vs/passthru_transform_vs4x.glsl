// ****TO-DO: 
//	1) declare uniform variable for MVP matrix; see demo code for hint
//	2) correctly transform input position by MVP matrix

layout (location = 0) in vec4 aPosition;

// (1)
uniform mat4 uMVP;

void main()
{
	// DUMMY OUTPUT: directly assign input position to output position
	//gl_Position = aPosition;

	// (2)
	gl_Position = uMVP * aPosition;
