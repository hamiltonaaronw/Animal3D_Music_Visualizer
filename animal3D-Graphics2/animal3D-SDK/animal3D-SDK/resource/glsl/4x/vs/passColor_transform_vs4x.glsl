// ****TO-DO: 
//	1) declare uniform variable for MVP matrix; see demo code for hint
//	2) correctly transform input position by MVP matrix
//	3) declare attribute for vertex color input
//	4) declare varying to pass color input to fragment shader
//	5) assign vertex color input to varying

layout (location = 0) in vec4 aPosition;

// (1)
uniform mat4 uMVP;

// (3)
layout (location = 3) in vec4 aColor;

// (4)
out vec4 vPassColor;

void main()
{
	// DUMMY OUTPUT: directly assign input position to output position
	//gl_Position = aPosition;

	// (2)
	gl_Position = uMVP * aPosition;

	// (5)
	vPassColor = aColor;
}
